# Library-Management-System
My first Java program! It is a library management system with a small graphical user interface. 

The Menu class serves as the entry point for the program. It provides a simple menu-driven interface to perform the following tasks:

Add Books: Allows librarians to add new books to the library by entering book details.
Add Users: Enables librarians to add new users to the system by providing user information.
Display Books: Displays all books currently available in the library.
Borrow/Check Out Books: Allows users to borrow books by specifying the book ID and their user ID.
Return Books: Enables users to return borrowed books by specifying the book ID and their user ID.
Exit: Allows users to exit the application.
Usage:
(any IDE will work, no need for extra languages other than java)
Compile: Compile the source code of the Library Management System using a Java compiler.
Run: Execute the compiled Java program (LibraryManagementSystem) to launch the application.
Menu Interface: Upon running the program, users will be presented with a menu-driven interface.
Menu Options: Select the desired option from the menu to perform the corresponding task.
Follow Prompts: Follow the prompts and input instructions provided by the application to add books, add users, borrow/return books, or search for books.
